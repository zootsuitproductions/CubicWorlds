# CubicWorlds

To set up this plugin, drop the CubicWorlds.jar file into the plugins folder of your spigot/bukkit server and restart it. 
Then, when you load in, stand at a spot in the minecraft world you would like to turn into a cube and run /createcubeworld <face radius>. 
This will take the the terrain relative to where you are standing and fold it into a cube.


When it's done copying everything, it will notify you can you can restart the server. 
Thanks to linear alegbra transformations, you will find yourself on a cubic world with gravity on each side!
